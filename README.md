SEEDUP is a Open Source shield that uses ESP32-CAM, Arduino Nano v3 and MCP23016 to fully control an hidroponic system.
The develop started back in 2015 as a small board to control an hidriponic system using the well know Arduino Nano board and after some months migrated to the Particle Platform that allow control over Wifi.
